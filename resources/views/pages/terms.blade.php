    <p>We do not in the ordinary course pre-screen or monitor content of the web sites or public areas, nor on-line postings or other communications. However, we reserve the right, but not the obligation, to determine in our sole discretion what is and is not acceptable content on any web site or in any other communication or posting made in connection with the Services, to limit placement of any content on a web site or on any other area provided in connection with the Services, to remove, alter or block access to any content immediately and without prior notice, to determine in our sole and absolute discretion what is and is not an appropriate conduct and use of any of the Services, and to cease providing or bar access to any or all of the Services to any User at any time, for any reason or for no reason, without prior notice. We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to monitor and investigate complaints regarding any of the foregoing, and you agree to cooperate fully with us in providing access and information as may be requested at any time and from time to time. You agree that any reservation of rights by us imposes no obligation of any kind on us to take any of the foregoing actions.



    <p>Access to an association's web site and other portions of the Services, including content, is password protected. Currently, we also offer web site content backup Services to assist in the protection of content from loss.

Ultimately, the security of any association's web site, and of access to and of all content and data located on, any web site, are the responsibility of each association, its management company and/or the members of the association. Content and data on any web site may be subject to loss, alteration, corruption or destruction, and we shall have no responsibility therefore.</p>

    <h4>11. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h4>

    <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning your use of the Services and the relationship between you and us, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, representations or understandings concerning the subject matter. You may be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by a separate agreement between Users, for example a separate agreement between an association and its management company or between members and their association or its management company. We are not bound by or subject to any such agreements. In addition, we may have entered into separate agreements with less than all Users, for example an agreement between us and a management company. If you are not a party to any such agreement, then you agree that you are not subject to it, are not entitled to enforce it, and are not a third party beneficiary of it. You agree that you are not relying on any representation, warranty, guarantee or statement of any kind or nature made by us or anyone on our behalf except as set forth in these Terms of Service. If any provision of the Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</p>



    <p>No waiver of any breach or failure or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy of any provision of these Terms of Service shall constitute a waiver of the same or any other provision hereof with respect to prior, concurrent or subsequent occurrences and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom such waiver is sought. These Terms of Service, and any dispute arising pursuant to these Terms of Service, shall be governed by Colorado law, exclusive of its provisions regarding conflicts of law. Any action relating to these Terms of Service must be brought in Denver, Colorado, and both parties irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Denver, Colorado.</p>



    <p>Titles and headings are included solely for convenient reference and are not part of these Terms of Service. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations (in whole or in part) without our prior written consent, which we may withhold, in our sole discretion. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms of Service without your prior written consent.</p>
