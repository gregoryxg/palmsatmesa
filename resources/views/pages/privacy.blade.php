    <h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>We respect the privacy and security of your
personally identifiable information that we collect about you online. The
following describes our privacy policy and practices with respect to that
information. By your registration to use or use of the Services, you consent to
our collection and use of your personally identifiable information and other
information online by us in the manner set forth in this Online Privacy Policy.
Please read this policy carefully. We may change this policy from time to time,
and we will post those changes on this page. Please check back periodically.</p>

    <h4>What is "personally identifiable information?"</h4>

    <p>Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you as a unique individual, such as your name; home, email or other address; telephone number; birth date; credit card number; and similar personal information.</p>

    <h4>What personally identifiable information do we collect about you through our online services?</h4>

    <p>We collect personally identifiable information about you in a number or different ways through our online Services.</p>

    <p>Your association or its management company may give us personally identifiable information about you to permit us to verify your identity as a person who is entitled to register to use and to continue to
use the Services we provide to you and your association through your association's management company. When you register to use Services, we will ask for certain personally identifiable information to confirm your identity as
a person authorized to use the Services. This information is required to be complete and accurate at the time it is given, and to be updated so that it is at all times accurate and complete, as a condition of your continued ability to
use the Services.</p>

    <p>Once you have registered to use the Services, whenever you sign in to use the Services your personal identity is known to us.</p>

    <p>Other personally identifiable information about you may be given to us by the association, its management company, or you in order to render the Services. For example, we may assist the association's
management company in compiling an electronic database of members of the association, or posting an online directory of members.</p>

    <p>You may give your credit card number to the association or its management company through the Services in order to pay your association's dues or assessments. However, prior to its transmission to your
association's (or its management company's) bank, your credit card information is encrypted through the use of secure server software and is then transmitted in this secure and encrypted fashion. Your credit card information is not
retained by us.</p>

    <p>If you send an email message, we will receive your email address and any other personally identifiable information you may include in that message.</p>  

    <h4>Our use of cookies: what they are and how we use them?</h4>

    <p>A cookie is a small data file that a web server
        sends to your web browser (your computer's hard drive) so it can be later read
        by the web server. We use cookies to help us identify you so that you are able
        to use Services that are restricted to authorized users. We may also use
        cookies for purposes such as tracking web site or Services use, length and
        nature of use, number of members, traffic patterns and other business purposes.
        We may do this in an anonymous fashion (in a manner that does not attempt to personally
        identify the user); however, once you have registered to use our service, you
        are no longer anonymous to us when you use our Services.</p>

    <p>When users or other visitors visit a web site
that we manage, our web servers automatically record certain information and
retain it in the web servers' logs. This information may include your IP
address, domain name, browser type, date and time of the visit and similar
information that is not normally considered "personally identifiable
information".</p>

    <h4>Who is collecting the information?</h4>

    <p>As explained above, we collect personally identifiable information about you in connection with the provision of our
Services. Contractors that we engage to provide some of the Services may also
collect personally identifiable information about you in connection with the
performance of those Services. We require those contractors to adhere to
privacy policies no less stringent than our Online Privacy Policy. Web sites
that are linked to our site may also collect personally identifiable
information about you. We have no control over the information gathering
practices of those sites and they are not covered by our Online Privacy Policy.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any such third party.</p>

    <p>In the course of using the Services, you may
provide personally identifiable information to others. For example, you might
post a message to a message board or send an email to another member, your
association or the association's management company, that may contain
personally identifiable information. We do not control the privacy practices or
policies of any such person or entity, and they are not covered by this Online
Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h4>How is the information used?</h4>

    <p>We use your personally identifiable information
that we collect through your use of the Services to provide the Services, and
to help us improve our Services. We may share anonymous information, or
information that is "aggregated," to better understand the users of
our Services and enhance or improve our Services, but we will do so only in a
manner that does not personally identify you.</p>

    <h4>Who do we share the information with?</h4>

    <p>We do not sell or rent your personally
identifiable information in the normal course of our business; however, if all
or substantially all of our assets are sold to a third party, your personally
identifiable information will be included in the assets transferred. We share
your personally identifiable information with your association and the
association's management company, on whose behalf we are providing the
Services. We also share the information with third parties that may provide a
portion of the Services. We do not allow such third parties to use that
information other than in connection with the provisions of the Services. We
may disclose personally identifiable information to any third party if required
to do so by law or regulation, or if we believe in good faith that such
disclosure is necessary to:</p>

    <p>(a) comply with legal process;</p>

    <p>(b) enforce the Terms of Service;</p>

    <p>(c) respond to claims that any content of any portion of the Services violated the rights of third parties; or</p>

    <p>(d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, other Users or the public.</p>

    <h4>What are your choices regarding the collection, use and distribution of your information?</h4>

    <p>If we wish to collect, use or share your
personally identifiable information through our online Services in a way that
is not provided in this Online Privacy Policy, we will notify you and you will
always have the option of not permitting the collection, use or transfer.
However, if such proposed collection, use or transfer is a condition of our
provision of any of the Services, your refusal to grant permission may result
in your inability to use all or a portion of the Services. </p>

    <p>By modifying your browser preferences, you have
the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to
reject all cookies. However, if you choose to reject all cookies or if you
enable other software that prevents cookies from operating, you will be unable to
use the Services.</p>

    <h4>How you can correct inaccuracies in or update your information?</h4>

    <p>Personally identifiable information about you may
be contained in an online database maintained in connection with provision of
the Services. Your personally identifiable information that is contained in any
such database should be accessible by you online, if you wish to correct any
inaccuracies, as long as you are an authorized User of the Services. Obviously,
certain personally identifiable information, such as the address of the “unit”
that you own, cannot be changed without verification by your association or its
management company. We are not responsible for information contained in such
online databases.</p>

    <p>We may maintain our own separate databases in
order to provide the Services, to which you will not have online access. For
example, we may maintain one or more databases of members of an association who
are entitled to become and remain users of the Services. Such databases may
contain information furnished by the association, its management company and/or
members, or otherwise collected as set forth in this Online Privacy Policy. If
you wish to ask us about the personally identifiable information that we may
have collected about you and that is not available to you online, you should
email us at <a href="mailto:Support@AssociationVoice.com">Support@AssociationVoice.com</a>. We will use commercially reasonable efforts
to comply with your request, and to update and/or correct any personally
identifiable information that is contained within such databases.</p>

    <h4>What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information?</h4>

    <p>Access to the Services, including to databases
containing personally identifiable information, is password protected. Any
personal information that you have posted in any portion of the Services (e.g.
a message board) should be accessible only by the association, the
association's management company, other members and other authorized Users of
the Services. It is the responsibility of each User to protect the User's
password. Do not divulge it to anyone. Log off your computer or close your
browser window to ensure that others cannot access your password. </p>

    <p>We use industry-standard software, hardware and
other measures, to protect the confidentiality, security and quality of
information we collect, and to protect it from unauthorized access or
disclosure or accidental loss, alteration or destruction. Due to the nature of
the Internet and computer security, we cannot warrant or guarantee that
security will never be breached.</p>

    <h4>How do we protect children's privacy?</h4>

    <p>You must be 18 years of age or older to register
to use the Services. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
information from children under the age of 13. If such information is
inadvertently or unknowingly collected, it is our policy to destroy or delete
it upon discovery.</p>
